                <h3>Benefits to Mental Health</h3>
                
                <p>
                    <img src="../final/img/bonding%201.jpg" alt="Bonding 1" width="300" height="300" class="image-left" loading="lazy">
                    Pets can reduce stress, improve mood, and provide companionship, all of which contribute to better mental health. 
                    The act of petting or cuddling with a pet has been shown to release oxytocin, a hormone that promotes feelings of happiness and reduces stress. 
                    Additionally, pets can encourage physical activity, as pet owners often engage in outdoor activities such as walking, playing, or even hiking with their pets. 
                    This not only helps improve physical health but also has a positive impact on mental well-being, as exercise is known to release endorphins, which are natural mood boosters. 
                    <img src="../final/img/bonding%202.jpg" alt="Bonding 2" width="300" height="300" class="image-right" loading="lazy">
                    Taking care of a pet can provide a sense of purpose, routine, and responsibility, which can be especially beneficial for those struggling with depression or anxiety. 
                    Pets often offer emotional support and nonjudgmental companionship, helping individuals feel less isolated. The bond between a pet and its owner can foster feelings of 
                    unconditional love and connection.
                </p>
                <h3>Benefits to Physical Health</h3> 
                <p>
                    <img src="../final/img/dog%20walk.jpg"  alt="A woman walking her dog" width="300" height="300" class="image-right" loading="lazy">
                    Pets encourage physical activity through walking, playing, and other forms of exercise, leading to better physical health.
                    Having a pet can also encourage a more active lifestyle by motivating owners to get outside and be more engaged in nature. 
                    This can improve overall stamina and physical coordination, as well as reduce the risk of chronic conditions such as obesity, 
                    diabetes, and heart disease. Pets can also help reduce the effects of sedentary behaviors by encouraging breaks from screen time, 
                    which is particularly important in today's digital age. These breaks promote better posture and reduce eye strain, fostering a healthier 
                    balance between technology use and physical activity.

                <h3>What Not to Do</h3>
                <p>    
                    Remember to properly train your pet, avoid overfeeding, and ensure they receive adequate care 
                    and attention to avoid common pet-related issues such as <strong>behavioral problems, obesity, and health 
                    complications. Proper nutrition, regular exercise,</strong> and <mark>routine veterinary check-ups</mark> are essential 
                    for maintaining your pet’s well-being. Instead of buying animals from pet stores or online, consider 
                    adopting from <strong>shelters</strong> or <strong>rescue groups</strong>. Many animals are waiting for 
                    <img src="../final/img/obese%20dog.jpg" alt="A picture of an obese dog" width="300" height="300" class="image-left" loading="lazy">
                    a loving home, and adoption gives them a second chance at a happy life. By choosing to adopt, you not only 
                    provide a forever home for a deserving pet but also help reduce the demand that supports <mark>irresponsible 
                    breeding</mark> and puppy mills, which often prioritize profit over the health and safety of animals.
