            <h1>What is Muay Thai?</h2>
            <p> Muay Thai, also known as Thai Boxing, has a rich and storied background that dates back over 2,000 years to the ancient kingdom of Siam, now known as Thailand. Originally developed for hand-to-hand combat by the Siamese military, it evolved from the battlefield tactics of Krabi Krabong, which involved the use of long and short weapons. Over time, these techniques were adapted into unarmed combat, known as Muay Boran, which eventually became the combat sport known as Muay Thai.</p>

                        <h3>Techniques</h3>
                        <p>Muay Thai, known as the “Art of Eight Limbs,” incorporates a variety of techniques using punches, kicks, elbows, and knees. Here are some key techniques used in Muay Thai:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Punches</strong>: Similar to Western boxing, Muay Thai includes jabs, crosses, hooks, and uppercuts. These punches are used to attack the head and body of the opponent.</li>
                            <li><strong>Kicks</strong>: The roundhouse kick is a signature move in Muay Thai, known for its power and reach. Other kicks include the front kick (Teep), diagonal kick, and axe kick.</li>
                            <li><strong>Elbow Strikes</strong>: Elbows are used for close-range attacks and can be delivered in various ways, such as horizontal, diagonal, and upward strikes. The spinning elbow is particularly devastating.</li>
                            <li><strong>Knee Strikes</strong>: Knees are powerful weapons in Muay Thai, used in both clinch fighting and at a distance. Techniques include the straight knee, flying knee, and diagonal knee.</li>
                            <li><strong>Clinch Fighting</strong>: The clinch is a unique aspect of Muay Thai, where fighters control their opponent’s posture and deliver knee strikes and elbows. It requires strength and technique to dominate the clinch.</li>
                            <li><strong>Defensive Techniques</strong>: Muay Thai also emphasizes defense, including blocking with the shins, parrying punches, and evading attacks. Fighters use their forearms and legs to block incoming strikes.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li><strong>Muay Mat</strong>: Muay Mat fighters are known for their powerful punches. They often aim to knock out their opponents with strong, decisive blows. This style emphasizes boxing techniques within the Muay Thai framework.</li>
                            <li><strong>Muay Tae</strong>: Specializing in kicks, particularly the roundhouse kick, Muay Tae fighters use their legs as their primary weapon. They aim to weaken their opponents with powerful kicks to the legs, body, and head.</li>

    <h1>Muay Thai Rules and Scoring</h1>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Attire</strong>: Fighters wear colored shorts (red or blue) and are not allowed to wear tops or shoes. Ankle guards and groin protectors are permitted. Fighters must also wear a Mongkhon (headband) and perform the Wai Kru ritual before the match.</li>
    <li><strong>Rounds</strong>: Professional Muay Thai matches typically consist of five rounds, each lasting three minutes, with a two-minute rest period between rounds.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Techniques</strong>: Fighters can use punches, kicks, elbows, knees, and clinch techniques. Strikes must be delivered with proper technique to score points.</li>
    <li><strong>Illegal Techniques</strong>: Headbutts, groin strikes, strikes to the back of the head, and attacks while the opponent is down are prohibited.</li>
    <li><strong>Weight Classes</strong>: Fighters are matched based on weight classes to ensure fair competition. There are 15 weight classes ranging from Mini Flyweight (105 lbs) to Heavyweight (over 175 lbs).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Judges</strong>: There are three judges who score the fight based on the fighters' performance in each round.</li>
    <li><strong>Scoring Criteria</strong>:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Proper Technique Execution</strong>: This is the most significant factor, accounting for about 70% of the score. Judges look for clean, powerful, and effective strikes that visibly impact the opponent.</li>
    <li><strong>Damage to the Opponent</strong>: This accounts for about 15% of the score. Judges consider the physical damage inflicted on the opponent.</li>
    <li><strong>Ring and Action Dominance</strong>: This includes control of the ring and the ability to dictate the pace and flow of the fight, accounting for about 10% of the score.</li>
    <li><strong>Effective Aggression</strong>: This is the least significant factor, accounting for about 5% of the score. Judges look for fighters who are actively trying to engage and land strikes.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Round Scoring</strong>: Each round is scored using a 10-point must system, where the winner of the round receives 10 points, and the loser receives 9 or fewer points, depending on their performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Overall Scoring</strong>: Unlike some other combat sports, Muay Thai fights are scored in their entirety rather than round by round. This means a fighter can lose several rounds but still win the fight if they dominate the rounds they win.</li>
    </ul>
